PoC to explore the [Competing Consumers Pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/competing-consumers) with event hubs
-----
This project was built in tandem with Microsoft's CSE (Commercial Software Engineering) team during our annual One Week hack in Seattle
to explore various messaging patterns utilizing a variety of 
Microsoft servives, including Event Hubs, Service Bus, Event Grid, Kafka, and Redis.

I worked on the Event Hub portion of this project, which is well documented and can be found in [feature/event-hub/OneWeek-Eventing.CompetitingConsumer.Provider.EventHub](https://github.com/DaveVoyles/eventhub-message-pattern-poc/tree/feature/event-hub/OneWeek-Eventing.CompetitingConsumer.Provider.EventHub)
directory.
